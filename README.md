Flappy Bird Game 🐦
===================

Overview
--------

This is a basic implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game built using Python and the Pygame library. The project serves as a learning exercise to understand how Pygame works and to practice game development concepts. 🚀

Description
-----------

Although this project is very basic, I created it to explore how Pygame works by following a tutorial. At certain points, the development process was a bit tricky, but by referring to the documentation and experimenting, I managed to complete it. 🎉 The game features a bird that navigates through a series of pipes by flapping to avoid collisions. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by passing through as many pipes as you can. 🏆

Features
--------

-   Simple 2D graphics using Pygame 🎨
-   Basic game mechanics: bird movement, pipe generation, and collision detection ⚙️
-   Score tracking 📊
-   Game over screen 😢

Installation
------------

To run this game locally, follow these steps:

1.  Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher recommended). 🐍

2.  Install Pygame by running:

    ```
    pip install pygame

    ```

3.  Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone <your-repository-url>

    ```

4.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd <project-directory>

    ```

5.  Run the game:

    ```
    python flappy_bird.py

    ```

How to Play
-----------

-   Press the **Spacebar** to make the bird flap and rise. ⬆️
-   Avoid hitting the pipes or the ground. 🚫
-   Try to pass through as many pipes as possible to increase your score. 🌟

Dependencies
------------
